### Hi, I'm John 

ðŸ‘‹

I've been working within engineering and technology throughout my career, from electronic circuit design and embedded systems to designing and implementing SME network infrastructures. Over the years Iâ€™ve always enjoyed scripting and coding as part of my roles, and in the past few years had the opportunity the develop several Python based projects to help a freight company with Brexit customs data flow.
