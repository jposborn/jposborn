### Hi, My name is John Osborn 

ðŸ‘‹

I've been working within engineering and technology throughout my career, from electronic circuit design and embedded systems to designing and implementing SME network infrastructures. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed coding as part of my roles and over the years more recently had the opportunity the develop several Python based projects to help a freight company with Brexit customs data flow.

ðŸŒ±

I recently took a career / study break and Iâ€™m now looking for a new challenge by seeking my first full time role in Python development. My current study is focused on the development of Flask based RESTful APIâ€™s.
