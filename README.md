### Hi, I'm John 

ðŸ‘‹

I've been working within engineering and technology throughout my career, from electronic circuit design and embedded systems to designing and implementing SME network infrastructures. Over the years Iâ€™ve always enjoyed scripting and coding as part of my roles, and over the past few years had the opportunity the develop several Python based projects to help a freight company with Brexit customs data flow.

ðŸŒ±

I recently took a career / study break and Iâ€™m now looking for a new challenge by seeking my first full time role in Python development. My current study is focused on the development of RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework.
